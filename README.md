# Space Crashers
Space Crashers is a 2D recreation of the Atari game Asteroids with the addition of a couple abilities to make the game feel a bit different. The goal of the player is to survive as long as possible and collect as many points as they can by shooting the asteroids and staying alive as long as possible. The high score is stored in local browser storage and gives players something to compete against when playing the game.
The development of this project was done for an introductory web development class relavent to the construction of web games. The constraints of this project were to utilize the PixiJS library and to create at least one ES6 class to represent an object in your game. I utilized the ES6 class setup to have a bit of inheritance for the large and small asteroid types and utilized PixiJS to render everything to the screen in the browser.
